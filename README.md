# mdnscheckup
See if MDNS is working, and try to get it working if not. Windows 11 randomly fails at it (does not list devices). No one knows why. Some say turn off IPv6, but some with IPv6 enabled work. Some say power cycle the computer. Bonjour or not has no effect. Earlier editions of Windows 10 do not come with MDNS, but updated Windows 10 generally works.
